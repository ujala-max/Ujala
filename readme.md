Subject Git And Jira

Hi Student,How Are You?
I am doing good. I am currently working on a project that involves using Git and Jira.
My project is a simple web application that allows users to create and manage their tasks. I am using
Git for version control and Jira for project management.
I am using Git for version control because it allows me to track changes to my code and collaborate with
others. I am using Jira for project management because it allows me to plan and track my project
s progress.
